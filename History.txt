==================================

This document tracks the changes made to the codebase of the
Add-In called "The Tree Surgeon" by grigri, 2006.

07/08/2006 : v1.0
-----------------

Initial Version

08/08/2006 : v1.1
-----------------

Changes:

* Added this file.

* Enabled support for VB IDE SDI mode (welcome to acronym hell)
  - Added 3 functions to ApiDeclares.bas for window drilling
  - Changed the project window detection function to use them
  - Added a "paranoid check" in case the window is not found.
  
* Moved Custom-Draw variables from Static (in TreeSurgeon::ProjectWndProc())
  to module-level private.
  
* Added code to release the 2nd timer (icon cache refresh) on exit.

* Moved the MiniDemo code to a separate class module (MiniDemo.cls).
  (Also changed a few minor points in MiniDemo.cls)

* Converted all class modules to private (can't think why I didn't do this before).
  This involved changing some structure arguments to pointers (Bitmap::GetBits())
